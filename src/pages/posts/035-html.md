# HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language.

is the foundation of the modern web. It is the language that web developers use to create the structure and content of websites, and it has been used to build the vast majority of websites on the internet today. HTML is a relatively simple language, but it is incredibly powerful, and it is essential for anyone who wants to build a website or work with web development.
In this blog post, we will explore what HTML is, how it works, and why it is so important in web development.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. It is not a programming language, like Java or Python, but rather a markup language that provides structure and content to a web page. In other words, HTML is a set of tags and attributes that define the structure and content of a web page. HTML tags are used to define the various elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.
HTML was first created in the late 1980s by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is often referred to as the inventor of the World Wide Web. At the time, Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and he wanted to create a way for scientists to share information over the internet. HTML was the language that he came up with to do this.

## How does HTML work?
HTML works by using tags to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are written in angle brackets (<>) and are placed before and after the content that they define. For example, the `<h1>` tag is used to define a heading, and it is written like this:
`<h1>This is a Heading</h1>`
The text "This is a Heading" is the content of the heading, and it is placed between the opening and closing `<h1>` tags. This tells the web browser that the text should be displayed as a heading, and it also gives the heading a specific level, which is used for formatting and accessibility purposes.
HTML also uses attributes to provide additional information about an element. Attributes are added to an element's opening tag and provide additional information about the element. For example, the `<img>` tag is used to define an image, and it has an attribute called "src" that is used to specify the URL of the image:
`<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">`
In this example, the "src" attribute is used to specify the URL of the image, and the "alt" attribute is used to provide a text description of the image. This is important for accessibility purposes, as it allows users with screen readers to understand the content of the image.

## Why is HTML important?
HTML is important for several reasons. First, it is the foundation of the modern web. Without HTML, it would be impossible to create websites that are accessible to users all over the world. HTML provides a common language that web browsers can understand, which allows developers to create websites that can be viewed on any device, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.
Second, HTML is essential for search engine optimization (SEO). Search engines like Google and Bing use HTML to understand the content of a web page, which allows them to rank the page in their search results. By using HTML tags correctly, web developers can help search engines to understand the structure and content of their web pages, which can improve their search engine rankings and drive more traffic to their site.
Third, HTML is a relatively simple language to learn, which makes it accessible to people who are new to web development. While HTML can be used in combination with other languages like CSS and JavaScript to create more complex websites, it is possible to create a simple website using just HTML. This makes it

## Conclusion

HTML makes up the web and is the skeleton to basically everything you see on the web! This is why its vital to have an understanding of it if you want to learn to become a web developer, contrary to popular belief it is not actaully considered a language!
